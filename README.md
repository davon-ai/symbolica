# Symbolica AI 🤖

About Symbolica

Symbolica is an AI research lab pioneering the application of category theory to enable logical reasoning in machines.

We’re a well-resourced, nimble team of experts on a mission to bridge the gap between theoretical mathematics and cutting-edge technologies, creating symbolic reasoning models that think like humans – precise, logical, and interpretable. While others focus on scaling data-hungry neural networks, we’re building AI that understands the structures of thought, not just patterns in data.

Our approach combines rigorous research with fast-paced, results-driven execution. We’re reimagining the very foundations of intelligence while simultaneously developing product-focused machine learning models in a tight feedback loop, where research fuels application.

Founded in 2022, we’ve raised over $30M from leading Silicon Valley investors, including Khosla Ventures, General Catalyst, Abstract Ventures, and Day One Ventures, to push the boundaries of applying formal mathematics and logic to machine learning.

Our vision is to create AI systems that transform industries, empowering machines to solve humanity’s most complex challenges with precision and insight. Join us to redefine the future of AI by turning groundbreaking ideas into reality.

What We Offer

Competitive salary + early-stage equity package.
High-trust, execution-first culture with minimal bureaucracy.
Direct ownership of meaningful projects with tangible impact.
A rare chance to work at the interface of deep research and real-world productization.
